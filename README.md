# SafeBadges - `roblox-ts` Edition

**SafeBadges** is an open-source Roblox module designed to simplify and enhance the process of awarding badges within your game *(… or experience)*. With **SafeBadges**, you can award badges to players with *reliability, safety, and precision*. :herb:

(Link the the original DevForum post [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/safebadges-an-open-source-reliable-safe-and-precise-way-to-award-badges/3119785).)

This package is simply a reupload of [@erazias](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/erazias)'s original code with typings. Go give her some love!

That also means that this package is **not** an officially supported version of SafeBadges. (It should be the same, but you never know.)

## Permissions/License

I asked @erazias on the Roblox DevForum if I could upload her code to NPM with typings. This is what she said:

> Hi, if you were to do that, I would request that you:
>
> 1. Credit me and provide a link to the original DevForum post
> 2. Show me your ts version of the module before publishing it
> 3. Clarify that it is not a officially supported version of SafeBadges
>
> I’d prefer it be done this way, however, I have no issue with you doing it under these terms.
