I asked @erazias on the Roblox DevForum if I could upload her code to NPM with typings. This is what she said:

> Hi, if you were to do that, I would request that you:
>
> 1. Credit me and provide a link to the original DevForum post
> 2. Show me your ts version of the module before publishing it
> 3. Clarify that it is not a officially supported version of SafeBadges
>
> Iâ€™d prefer it be done this way, however, I have no issue with you doing it under these terms.
